			<h2>My competitive programming journey</h2>

			<br/>
			<p>Competitive programming is like math competitions but with programming, 
				so it's twice as cool. 
				<br/>
				I have been involved with it for 6 years, though I mostly practiced during
				 the first 2 and later focused on other things.
				<br/>
				This is still my most well-developed skill. 
				I have participated in many on-site and online competitions, 
				it was a big part of my life. 
				<br/>
				However, now solely improving my competitive programming skills
				is not as rewarding and productive as learning industry-related programming skills.
				<br/>
				I still solve problems that once in a while catch my attention 
				and occasionally coach to make some income. 
				<br/>
				For some time I was trying to hit master on codeforces 
				and after many attempts I managed to do it.
